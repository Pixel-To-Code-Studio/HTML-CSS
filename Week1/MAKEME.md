# Homework HTML/CSS Week 1

## Todo list

1. Preparation exercises
2. Command Line Interface
3. CSS Challenges
4. Code along
5. PROJECT: Digital Resume

### **1. Preparation exercises**

> Preparation exercises are exercises that you should work on _before_ the session on Friday. These are a little more difficult or show an important concept and as such are a great exercise to talk about with your mentor. Have a solution ready by Friday as you may be asked to show what you did.

Inside your `HTML-CSS` fork, go to the folder `week1`. Inside of that folder, navigate to `/preparation-exercises`. For each exercise, you will find a separate folder. The `README` explains what needs to be done. There will also be some questions at the bottom to think about. Go through them _before_ the session on Sunday as it will be covered then.

### **2. Command Line Interface challenge**

> Before you start any of the exercises, make sure to create a folder on your desktop that will hold all of your exercise files. Give the folder the name `ptcs-html-exercises`. Inside, create a `week1` folder and will hold this week's exercise files inside.

Using the CLI, create a plain text file (`.txt`) that contains the commands necessary to answer the following questions:

1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like `/c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun`?
3. Write more than one command that will create a file that looks like the following (you are **not** allowed to use the newline character (\n)):

```
first message
second message
```

### **3. CSS Challenges**

In order to improve you need to practice a lot! In the following challenges you'll work with CSS, starting from the absolute basics to building a page:

- [CSS Challenges](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/CSS_challenges): Do challenge #1 to #6.
- [CSS Battle Challenges](https://cssbattle.dev/battle/1) Do challenge #1 to #6. **_You will need to create an account (It's free)_**

### **4. Code along**

A big part of learning web development is through learning by example. In the following video you'll learn how to build a simple website, using basic HTML & CSS:

### **5. PROJECT: Digital Resume**

> Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

In the following assignment you'll make your own Digital Resume. Here are the requirements that need to be fulfilled:

- It needs to be one webpage
- Your project folder should contain two files: a `.html` and a `.css` file
- Include the following pieces of information:
  - Some personal information (Note: _the page will be public on the whole internet_ for our review, so as a privacy-conscious individual, feel free to use fake information here)
  - A picture of you (or a fake one, https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ provides AI generated faces)
  - A few lines about who you are
  - Education (list at least 1 education institute)
  - Work experience (list at least 1 workplace)

When writing the HTML include the following:

- Different types of headings, like `<h1>` and `<h2>`
- An unordered list (`<ul>`). Use this to list out your educational background
- Another unordered list (`<ul>`).
- An `<img>` tag (for your picture)
- Some `<p>` tags

When writing the CSS include the following:

- Some CSS properties, like: `margin`, `padding`, `color`, etc.
- You are **NOT** allowed to use CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS, etc.)
- Bonus: look into using [flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE) or [grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFafSYg-PkI)

## SUBMIT YOUR HOMEWORK!

After you've finished your todo list it's time to show us what you got! The homework that needs to be submitted is the following:

1. The CLI challenge
2. A link to your *deployed* Digital Resume! Remember your CLI knowledge to figure out the URL to it (a webserver is just a computer and so the directories are part of the URL!)

Upload both in a repository to GitHub and then upload the link to it on the Trello board: "Feedback Assignments". Go through the [guide](../hand-in-homework-guide.md) to learn how to do this.
